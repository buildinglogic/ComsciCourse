## Overview

The goal of this project is to implement two parts of the Raft consensus protocol. 
Ref: "In search of an understandable consensus algorithm"

In the first part of the project, for all three models (leader, candiate and follower) we will implement the leader-election protocol. In the second part, we implement the log-repair protocol. 

This project aims to learn RAFT consensus algorithm for distributed system and get familar with Remote project call (RPC) implementation.
