## Overview:

This project help understand call stack vulnerabilities and debuggers like the GNU Debugger (GDB).

The objective of this project is to compromise a Ubuntu Linux machine running a vulnerable process. 

We will use a shellcode to compromise the server, which is described. Once we have compromised your server, we should modify the files hosted by the server as proof. 
In particular, we will need to use a reverse shellcode so that we can remotely send commands to the server we take over.
