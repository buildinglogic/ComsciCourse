# Overview:
For this project you will implement a basic heap manager. The standard C runtime library provides a standard heap manager through the malloc and free library calls. For this project you will implement your own version of this interface. 


# What we did: 
We modified the code under dmm.c:
dmalloc and dfree

We did not use ALIGN for our functions, since we think it's not necessary with linkedlist implementation of heap manager.

We did not ref to any online coding. We simply follow the instuctions from the course handout.
