## Overview:

This project will give you experience writing simple multi-threaded programs using monitors and will help you understand how threads and monitors are implemented. 

The project has two parts. 

In the first part, you will write a simple concurrent program that schedules deli orders. This concurrent program will use a thread library that we provide. 

In the second part, you will implement your own version of this thread library.
